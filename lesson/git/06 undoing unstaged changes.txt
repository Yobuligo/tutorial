you made a change within a file. The change is still unstaged, which means it was not added to the staging area (by command add .)
now you want to undo that change.
Therefore use the command checkout. Alternatively the command git restore can be used, which does exactly the same.

git checkout <filename>, which loads the last version of that file

git checkout .      -> means to reload all files which were changed but are not staged yet.

if a new file was created use the command
git clean -dn       -> to list all files which would be deleted
git clean -df       -> to force the deletion of the files which were changed but which are not staged yet.
