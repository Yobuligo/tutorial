Branches are used to group changes. A branch can have several commits. It is possible to have various branches.
To create a branch the following command can be used.

    git branch <branch-name>

Now the branch was only created. To switch to that branch the checkout command can be used.

    git checkout <branch-name>

To do both in one, which means to create a branch and to switch to that branch, the checkout command can be used with parameter -b

    git checkout -b <branch-name>
