Detached Head
- It is possible to checkout branches and commits
- Whenever a branch is checked out, the head is set to the current branch
- Whenever a commit is checked out, the head is detached (we are not in a specific branch)

Imagine we have a branch, the master branch with several commits (c1 .. c3)
master(c1, c2, c3) 

Now we create a new branch feature that gets all the previous commits.
feature(c1, c2, c3, c4)

If we would checkout now the commit c2 for example, than git could not be aware about to which HEAD (branch) the commit belongs, because c2 belongs two both branches.
That is why we have a detached HEAD. The HEAD is unknown
