What is the different between forking and cloning? Forking means "gabeln", maybe "verzweigen".

Forking is not a feature of git but of github. 
Clone is a specific git command but there is no git command to fork.


A pull request is an extension, correction of code, which should be added to an existing repository. Imagine the developer forked a repository. So the user is no collaborator, which could commit maybe directly in a repository.
So instead, to provide a change, the user has to create a pull request. The pull request means to request to merge the correction in a repository. 
The integration of a pull request must be done by a member or owner of the repository. Even it is requested by an external user of the repository.
