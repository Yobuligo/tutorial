It is even possible to work together on private repositories. 
Open the repository -> settings -> Manage Access -> Invite Collaborator

Here there is not need to provide a separate access token. Instead the invites users access token can be used.

Collaboration is not contributing.
Contributing means more to add value to a project, repository what ever, but the contributor must not be part of a repository, organization or team.
