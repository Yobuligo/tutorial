Readme.MD 
MD stands for markdown which is a lightweight markup language for writing documentation. 
Each git repository can have a README.md file which contains information about the project, which means what is it good for, rules for contributing, etc.

If you create a git repository with your name (which is a secret (some kind of easter egg)), you can provide more personal information about you.
