As in the previous lesson explained there is a separate remote tracking branch, which is used by the local and remote branch to communicate with each other.
Using the command

git branch -a 

would only display the local branches and the remote tracking branches. To also get the remote branches the following command can be used:

git ls-remote

The command

git fetch origin 

would help to update the remote tracking branches. So after calling the command git branch -a, a list would be displayed which also contains the remote branches, which were fetched from the remote repository.
