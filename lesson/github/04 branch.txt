Remote repositories also contain branches.
To display all branches, which means local and remote branches, the following command can be used

git branch -a   (displays the local- and the remote branches)
git branch -r   (displays the remote branches)

Behind the science there are 3 different types of branches involved.

branch types:
local branch                            - master                
                                            |   ^
                                            V   |

remote tracking branch                  - remote/origin/master
                                            |   ^ 
                                            V   |

remote branch (origin repository)       - master

What you can see is, that the remote branch is not directly connected with the local branch. There is always this remote tracking branch between them. 
The remote tracking branch is a local copy of the remote branch, which cannot be edit by the developer and managed by the system.
This means when calling push or pull the communication always goes over the remote tracking branch.
Pulling actually means:
1. to call "git fetch" on the "remote master branch" from the "remote tracking remote/origin/master branch" 
2. to call "git merge" on the "local master branch" from the "remote tracking remote/origin/master branch"
