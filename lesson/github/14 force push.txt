Imagine I have a commit, which is already pushed to the remote repository.
But I absolutely want to delete that commit. Than I can delete that commit by git reset.
When I would push the change to the remote repository, I would get an error, because I am behind the last remote commit. My local version is older than my remote version. Therefore I have to force the push as follows.

git reset --hard HEAD~1             - to delete the last commit
git push --force origin master      - to force pushing the change to the remote repository
