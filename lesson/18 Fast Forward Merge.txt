Fast forward:
Means to merge e.g. a feature branch to the master branch, while no additional commits were added to the master branch after the feature branch was created.
This means the changes of the feature branch can be integrated in the master branch directly. This also means there is no additional merge commit required. Instead the commits are handed over directly to the master branch.


git merge <branch-name>             - Merge branch with name <branch-name> into the current branch
git merge --squash <branch-name>    - Merge branch with name <branch-name> into the current branch without adding the commits of the branch with <branch-name>.
                                      This means if the <branch-name> had two commits C1 and C2, these Commits wouldn't be displayed within the target branch.
                                      In addition the HEAD wouldn't be "HEAD -> master, feature" (which means the HEAD is the same for master and feature) but only "HEAD -> master"
