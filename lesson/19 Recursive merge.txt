The recursive merge occurs or even can be triggered in the following scenario.
1. You have the master branch and create a feature branch out of the master branch.
2. The feature branch is extend by several changes which costs 2 commits.
3. But also the master branch is extended by changes and contains additional commits.

So it is not possible directly to fast forward the commits of the feature branch to the master branch. Perhaps there are conflicts.
Instead the merge takes over the changes and if no conflicts exists it automatically does a separate commit, but anyway there is that commit.
