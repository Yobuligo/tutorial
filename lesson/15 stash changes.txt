Whenever you did some changes in a branch and these changes shouldn't neither committed yet to the branch nor discarded, the command stash can be used to stash (verstauen) the changes separately.
Later you can access these stashed data.

git stash           - stash changes, which also means to restore the last state of the current branch
git stash apply     - apply stashed changes to the current branch - Means even if you switch the branch you can apply the stashed data to the new branch
